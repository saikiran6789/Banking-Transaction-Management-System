# Banking Transaction Management System

## 📌 Overview
The **Banking Transaction Management System** is a Java-based application built in **NetBeans** that connects with a **MySQL backend** to simulate core banking operations.  
It demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**, **multithreading**, and **exception handling** to ensure smooth, secure, and reliable banking transactions.  

The project provides a console/ATM-style interface for account management, transactions, and data persistence.
